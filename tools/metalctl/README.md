This tool will be used to refactor the Bash scripts provided in the ISO, and
progressively add new functionalities. For the sake of developer efficiency,
it will be written in Python, for now, but should be rewritten in Golang as
soon as possible (simpler to deliver a binary than a Python package with its
dependencies).
