Cluster Upgrade
===============

MetalK8s clusters are upgraded using the utility scripts packaged with
every new release.
This topic describes upgrading MetalK8s and all components included
in the stack.

Supported Versions
******************

.. note::

    MetalK8s supports upgrade of *at most* one major version at a time.
    For example:

    - from 123.1.2 to 124.2.0,
    - from 123.0.1 to 124.0.0.

    Refer to the
    `release notes <https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/releases>`_ for more
    information.

Prerequisites
*************

ISO Preparation
---------------

Provision a new MetalK8s ISO by running the utility script shipped
with the current installation.

.. parsed-literal::

   /srv/scality/metalk8s-X.X.X/iso-manager.sh -a <path_to_iso>

Pre-Checks
----------

Use the ``--dry-run`` option to validate your environment for upgrade:

.. code::

   /srv/scality/metalk8s-X.Y.Z/upgrade.sh --dry-run --verbose

This will simulate the upgrade pre-checks and provide an overview of
the changes to be carried out in your MetalK8s cluster.

.. important::

    The version prefix metalk8s-**X.Y.Z** must be the *new* MetalK8s version
    you want to upgrade to.
