Monitoring Stack
================

MetalK8s ships with a monitoring stack that uses charts, counts, and graphs
to provide a cluster-wide view of cluster health, pod status, node status,
and network traffic status.
Access the :ref:`Grafana Service<installation-services-grafana>`

The MetalK8s monitoring stack consists of the following main components:

  - :term:`Alertmanager`
  - :term:`Grafana`
  - :term:`Kube-state-metrics`
  - :term:`Prometheus`
  - :term:`Prometheus Node-exporter`
