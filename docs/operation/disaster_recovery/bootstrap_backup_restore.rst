Bootstrap Node Backup and Restoration
=====================================

This topic describes how to back up a MetalK8s bootstrap node manually,
and how to restore a bootstrap node from such a backup.

.. note::

   A backup is generated automatically:

   - at the end of the bootstrap,

   - at the beginning of an upgrade or downgrade,

   - at the end of an upgrade or downgrade,

   - at the end of a bootstrap restoration.

Backing Up a Bootstrap Node
***************************

To create a new backup file, run the following command:

.. parsed-literal::

    /srv/scality/metalk8s-|version|/backup.sh

Backup archives are stored in /var/lib/metalk8s/backups on all master nodes.

Restoring a Bootstrap Node
**************************

.. warning::

   You must have a highly available control plane with at least
   three members in the etcd cluster (including the failed bootstrap node),
   to use the restore script.

.. note::

   To restore a bootstrap node you need a backup archive and MetalK8s ISOs.
   All the ISOs referenced in the bootstrap configuration file (located in
   /etc/metalk8s/bootstrap.yaml) must be present.

#. Unregister the unreachable etcd member from the cluster by running
   the following commands from a working node with the etcd role:

   #. Get etcd container id.

      .. code::

         CONT_ID=$(crictl ps -q --label io.kubernetes.container.name=etcd --state Running)

   #. List all etcd members to get the ID of the etcd member that needs to be removed.

      .. code::

         crictl exec -it "$CONT_ID" \
            etcdctl --endpoints https://localhost:2379 \
            --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
            --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
            --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
            member list

   #. Remove the etcd member (replace ``<etcd_id>`` in the command).

      .. code::

         crictl exec -it "$CONT_ID" \
            etcdctl --endpoints https://localhost:2379 \
            --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
            --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
            --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
            member remove <etcd_id>

#. Because multiple bootstrap nodes are not supported, remove the old
   bootstrap node before performing the restoration by running the
   following commands from a working node with a master role:

   #. List all nodes to get the node name of the old bootstrap node that needs
      to be removed.

      .. code::

         kubectl get node --selector="node-role.kubernetes.io/bootstrap" \
            --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

   #. Remove the old bootstrap node (replace ``<node_name>`` in the command).

      .. code::

         kubectl delete node <node_name> --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

#. Mount the ISO.

#. Restore the bootstrap node. Replace ``<backup_archive>`` with the path to
   the backup archive you want to use, and ``<node_ip>`` with a
   control plane IP of one control plane node.

   .. code::

      /srv/scality/metalk8s-|version|/restore.sh --backup-file <backup_archive> --apiserver-node-ip <node_ip>
