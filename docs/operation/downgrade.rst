Cluster Downgrade
=================

MetalK8s clusters are downgraded using the utility scripts that are
packaged with your current installation.
This topic describes downgrading MetalK8s and all components included
in the stack.

Supported Versions
******************

.. note::

    MetalK8s supports downgrade of **at most** one major version at a time.
    For example:

    - from 124.2.0 to 123.1.2,
    - from 124.0.0 to 123.0.1.

    Refer to the
    `release notes <https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/releases>`_ for more
    information.

.. only:: downgrade_not_supported

   .. warning::

      Version |release| only supports downgrade of minor and patch version.

Prerequisites
*************

ISO Preparation
---------------

Provision a new **MetalK8s** ISO by running the utility script shipped
with the current installation.

.. code::

   /srv/scality/metalk8s-X.X.X/iso-manager.sh -a <path_to_iso>

Pre-Checks
----------

You can test if your environment will successfully downgrade with the following
command.

.. code::

   /srv/scality/metalk8s-X.Y.Z/downgrade.sh --destination-version \
     <destination_version> --dry-run --verbose

This will simulate the downgrade pre-checks and provide an overview of the
changes to be carried out in your MetalK8s cluster.

.. important::

    The version prefix metalk8s-**X.Y.Z** must be the *current* installed
    MetalK8s version.

Downgrade
*********

#. Run the utility script shipped with the *current* installation
   providing it with the destination version.

#. From the :term:`Bootstrap node`, launch the downgrade.

   .. parsed-literal::

      /srv/scality/metalk8s-X.Y.Z/downgrade.sh --destination-version <version>

.. important::

    The version prefix metalk8s-**X.Y.Z** must be the *current* installed
    MetalK8s version.
