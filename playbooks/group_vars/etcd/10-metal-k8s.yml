# Relax default memory limits for etcd processes.
# The Kubespray default for this value is 0 (unlimited) when a system has
# >= 4096MB of memory available, otherwise it's set to 512MB. Our recommended
# memory sizing for etcd nodes is 4GB. However, even if a system has 4GB of
# physical memory available, some kernels will report a slightly lower amount of
# total memory available, hence the etcd process would be restricted to 512MB of
# RAM (including kmem), and leave a large amount of memory allocated to this
# role unused.
# Instead of falling back to 512MB, let's assume that if an etcd node has less
# than 4096MB RAM available it's a dedicated etcd node, and the process can use
# up to 80% of the available memory.
# See: https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/issues/50
